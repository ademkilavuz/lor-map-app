    "description": "In August 2021, two limbs of a Wallangarra White Gum at Pymble Station were removed. The tree had a fungal disease making it too unstable to remain longterm in its present location. The team researched if there were any uses for the timber and found that Wallangarra White Gum timber is used in traditional tool making. TAP3 contacted local Aboriginal business Guringai Aboriginal Tours to ask if they would have a use for it. Laurie Bimson, owner was delighted to come to site to take \u2018bendy, dried out\u2019 sections for boomerangs and coolamuns. A Coolamun is a carrying vessel that resembles a small canoe shape. This versatile piece is used for carrying tools, babies, water or food.\u201cWhen I got the timber off you, I let it sit for a couple of days then I started the process of prying the bark off. Once the bark is off it needs to be held in shape while it dries out this takes about two weeks then I shape it and sand it and after I put a mixture of oil and turpentine on it this brings out the colour. I\u2019m very happy with how it turned out I will be making some more soon.\u201d",

Guringai country covers a large area to the north of Sydney Harbour up to Lake Macquarie and from the Pacific Ocean out to Wisemans Ferry. We look after this land and in turn the land looks after us.When I was young my dad taught me to survive. He showed me how to make spears and boomerangs and humpy\u2019s. He also showed me how to catch yabbies, eels and fish and what plants to eat. We were the only kids in the street with a humpy outside our back fence. We used to go down to the local aboriginal carvings all the time. We were Aboriginal and I was very proud. I was always envious of my Aboriginal friends dark skin \u2013 I wished mine was darker.

    "description": "As part of SEPA\u2019s strategy to increase visual cues and strengthen the awareness of our culture and our rich history and connection to first Australian traditions and country we proposed development of a SEPA story and artwork.  The plan behind this branding is to harness the richness of Indigenous culture and cultural traditions in understanding and sharing our own culture.  The intent is to share the stories of our people, their achievements, share and discuss the obstacles and improvements through story telling.  Acknowledging the 60,000 years of promoting the tradition of story telling in art form from through that of Aboriginal culture as a way of passing on knowledge and custodianship.  We believe that by celebrating Aboriginal culture through the creation of our own artefact and our story we have a mechanism to discuss and share in the way we come to work.  In turn we engage Aboriginal businesses and promote the inclusion of them in our supply chain and in recognition of a rich history of our first nations people we promote a workplace focussed on reconciliation and safety.Bring SEPA\u2019s story and culture to life in a graphical way using indigenous art.\nTo visually explain our SEPA story and our cultural journey.\nShow that community spirit and the creation of a positive, safe workplace based around respect and caring is important to us.\nCreate an opportunity and an open invitation to our people to join our mob (SEPA Family). The Wedge Tailed Eagle\nBunjil the eagle flies high in the top left-hand corner.\nBunjil is the Kulin nation creator and spiritual leader.\nThe symbol of Bunjil the eagle protects us and watches over this land, our people, the plants, and the environment.\n\u00a0\nPurple Creativity symbol\nBeneath the eagle lies the Creativity icon (the first of our CARES values).\nThe circles represent the peeling back of layers, constantly transforming and innovating over and over.\nThe circles have no end, representing that we will continue our endless pursuit to improve and learn. \n\u00a0\nGreen Accountability symbol\nThe green colour is linked to our commitment to doing what is asked of us and taking accountability for our actions.\nIt also represents the care we have for one another and the legacy and footprint we leave on the environment.\n\u00a0\nBlue Relationships symbol\nThis symbol represents our commitment to actively nurture and grow relationships, including our strategic direction of having great partnerships, involving all of our stakeholders and partners.\nIt invites our people to speak up and make a pledge to drive an inclusive and collaborative culture.\nIt symbolises our respectful exchange of ideas.\nIt also encourages our people to find opportunities to contribute and have a voice while at the same time, taking time to listen.\n\u00a0\nOrange Empowerment symbol\nThe two links represent our people coming together and that our people are empowered to lead change and support those who need a leg up.\nThe multiple links also symbolise that we act to solve problems together.\nIt symbolises that our people feel empowered to make their contribution in a positive, respectful manner.\n\u00a0\nYellow Safety symbol\nThis symbol represents the last of our CARES values, demonstrating our commitment to safely carry out our works.\nIntentionally the symbol is very much like the Next Gear cog, reinforcing the importance of safety across all that we do.\nIt represents the role that everyone plays in keeping the workplace safe and moving forward \u2013 it also represents we are about making and creating safer places. \n\u00a0\nThe 5 symbols and their importance\nAs standalone icons these symbols represent our commitment to our CARES values, Creativity, Accountability, Relationships, Empowerment and Safety.\nCollectively they represent the way we go to work.\nAt the macro level, four of the five symbols can also represent our Alliance partners LXRP, Laing O\u2019Rourke, Metro Trains Melbourne and Jacobs, while the fifth symbol defines our links to the communities whose lives our projects seek to transform.\n\u00a0\nThe Koori Eel trap\nMoving along our journey we now reach the Koori eel trap.\nThe Koori Eel trap reaches across our countryside, connecting the country and city, similar to our railway network.\nIt aligns with the Five LXRP Greats to deliver a great network.\nThe pebbles in the eel trap symbolise our people, coming into the third space as individuals but united as part of one mob/group. We commonly refer to our mob as the \u2019SEPA Family\u2019.\nThe third space is the intersection between who we are as individuals and what defines us (our background, our culture, our values and belief systems), and where we come together in the workplace. The third space is where we achieve and transform communities together.\nThe pebbles themselves are all different shapes and sizes, representing the individuality and diversity of our people and the value diversity brings to our SEPA Family.\nThe eel trap is always moving. Individuals come and go, but the eel trap constantly reforms and revitalises itself, always \u2019humming\u2019.\nThe pebbles in the eel trap represent GREAT PEOPLE coming together in a yarning circle through GREAT ENGAGEMENT.\nThe circular nature of the eel trap also represents Project Lifecycle Thinking, having the end in mind all the way from feasibility through to final completion.\nThe pebbles in the eel trap are white, which is a spirit colour representing the positive energy and attitude our people bring to the conversation. White also represents wholeness and completion, which brings together our end to end project lifecycle thinking.\n\u00a0\nGum Leaves\nWe now reach the bottom right of our artwork, where you find a series of gum leaves.\nThe gum leaves symbolise where our journey started and also where are story is going.\nIt started with a Welcome to Country and Smoking Ceremony led by Uncle Colin, a local indigenous man.\nUncle Colin brought a branch of gum leaves, found from trees across Victoria, and asked the AMT to each take a leaf.\nThe AMT reflected on the fact that the leaves came from trees that were here generations before us, and will continue to grow for future generations long after us.\nListening to Uncle Colin\u2019s personal stories and reflections really hit home to the AMT the importance of storytelling, like our SEPA story.\n\u00a0\nFish\nThe fish symbolise movement as well as change, which is an underlying theme across the whole artwork, as we evolve and grow as individuals and as a SEPA Family.\n\u00a0\nOverall\nThe large coloured areas in the background, with black and white pebbles, symbolise the GREAT PLACES, that are being created for the community to come together and share stories.\nThe vibrant colours represent the energy we bring to work and to each other.\nThe layering of symbols reflects SEPA\u2019s journey to date and that it is constantly evolving.\n\u00a0",

The station entry artwork highlights the natural beauty of the Armadale area and is a tribute to the resilience and significance of local wildlife.\n\nViaduct piers: showcasing local plants and wildlife\nArtwork on the viaduct piers will showcase the diverse animal and plant life in Armadale and the surrounding area and represent a journey through four distinct landscapes \u2013 river, wetlands, bush and scarp.

Each landscape will be represented by different colours - orange for the river, gold for the wetlands, green for the bush and blue for the Darling Scarp.
